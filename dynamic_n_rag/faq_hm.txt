FAQ H&M (English Translation)

What should I do if my package doesn’t contain a return label?
We have digitized our return process, and now you register your return digitally in our return portal on our website or app. This means that our orders no longer include a return label or return form. You can read more about how to make a return here.

Where can I find the QR code for my return via PostNord?
Once you’ve registered your return digitally through our return portal, a QR code will be sent to your email. You can find the email with the QR code by searching for “We have registered your return digitally” in your inbox. If you have the PostNord app installed on your phone, the QR code will also appear there shortly after registering your return in our portal. Show the QR code to the representative when dropping off your return.

Can I reserve products in-store?
It’s not possible to call any of our stores or reserve products in-store via customer service. Please use our "Find in store" feature instead.

Where is my refund?
Refunds are issued to the same payment method used for the purchase. Please note that it can take up to 14 days for your refund to be processed. Your delivery fee will be refunded if you return all items in your order.

Where is my return?
When we have processed your return at our warehouse, we will send you an email confirming the return. If you haven’t received a return confirmation after 14 days, please contact us with your order number, and our customer service team will assist you.

I am missing items from my order.
If an item is missing from your order, check whether any items were marked as out of stock in your delivery confirmation. You won’t be charged for items removed from the order. If you ordered from one of our external brands, the items will be delivered in a separate package. If there are missing items that haven’t been removed from your order, please contact us with your order details, and we will help you.

I received a defective item.
Return the defective item to us to receive a refund to your original payment method. You can find more information about returns here.

I want to cancel/change my order.
We start processing your order quickly, so unfortunately, no changes can be made once it’s confirmed. This includes changes to the delivery address or delivery options.

However, you might be able to modify these details directly with the courier or cancel the order and place a new one within a short timeframe after confirmation. Log in to My Account and view your online orders under My Purchases. If the “Cancel Order” button is visible, you can choose that option to cancel your order.

If the button isn’t visible, it’s too late to cancel your order as it has already started processing. In this case, you can instead make a return. More information on returns is available here.

I can’t pay with my gift card.
You can use your H&M gift card to shop online and in stores anywhere in Sweden. The gift card can also be used for purchases with all brands on our website.

To use the gift card online, select “Add gift card” in the Payment section during checkout. Enter the 19-digit number and 4-digit PIN code.

For physical cards, you’ll find the numbers on the back. You can pay for your entire order with the gift card or combine it with another payment method. Just make sure to use the gift card balance first to view other payment options.

If your gift card was issued outside Sweden, it’s only valid for purchases in-store and online in the country where it was issued.

About H&M
H&M (Hennes & Mauritz) is a global fashion company founded in 1947 in Västerås, Sweden, by Erling Persson. Initially called “Hennes,” it sold women’s clothing. In 1968, after acquiring the hunting and men’s outfitting store Mauritz Widforss, the company changed its name to Hennes & Mauritz. Since then, H&M has grown into an international fashion giant with thousands of stores worldwide.

Business Model and Products
H&M is known for its business model, which combines high-quality fashion at affordable prices. They offer a wide range of clothing, accessories, beauty products, and home decor for women, men, teenagers, and children. The company operates with a rapid turnover of fashion, introducing new collections frequently to match the latest trends.

H&M has also invested in sustainability through initiatives like the "Conscious Collection," which focuses on clothing made from recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Customers are encouraged to recycle old clothes in-store through the company's clothing collection program, in exchange for discount coupons.

Global Presence and Digitalization
H&M has a strong global presence, with stores in over 70 countries, making it one of the largest fashion chains in the world. The company has also heavily invested in digitalization and e-commerce to adapt to changing shopping behaviors. Through its online platform and mobile app, H&M offers customers the convenience of shopping from home, with seamless delivery and return options.

To enhance the digital customer experience, H&M has started experimenting with AI technologies that personalize offers and recommendations based on customer preferences and purchase history. This helps them stay competitive in the fast-paced fashion industry and deliver a more tailored shopping experience.

Sustainability and Social Responsibility
H&M has made clear steps toward becoming a more sustainable company. Its long-term goal is for all the cotton it uses to come from sustainable sources, and it aims to use only recycled or sustainably produced materials by 2030. The company is also committed to reducing its carbon footprint and becoming climate positive by 2040, meaning it will reduce more greenhouse gases than it emits.

On a social level, H&M works to improve working conditions in the textile industry by collaborating with various organizations and suppliers. It has initiatives like the "H&M Foundation," a nonprofit organization focused on education, clean water, equality, and disaster relief.

Challenges and the Future
Despite its success, H&M has faced some challenges, particularly with increasing competition from online-based companies like ASOS and Zalando, as well as growing consumer interest in more sustainable fashion. In response, H&M continues to invest in e-commerce and digital technology to improve its customer experience and streamline its supply chain.

The company’s future remains promising as it consistently adapts to new market conditions, innovative business models, and sustainable initiatives. Its ongoing focus on digitalization and sustainability demonstrates its commitment to leading the fashion industry into the future.
